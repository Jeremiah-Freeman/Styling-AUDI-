    <h1>Mercedes-AMG GT!</h1>
    <h2>Handcrafted by racers</h2>

    <p class ="important">Handcrafted AMG 4.0L "dry sump" V8s thrust power into a new era. Twin turbos mounted inside the "V" force-feed massive boost to each Direct Injected cylinder, and deliver 60 mph in 3.9 seconds for the 456-hp AMG GT, or just 3.7 seconds for the 503-hp AMG GT S. And its ample torque is unleashed from the get-go with a growling exhaust note
    </p>

    <p class ="important">Perfect proportions, with an extra portion of power.  The tautly drawn shape of the AMG GT S is sculpted to conquer wind and weight, and capture stares and hearts. Its proportions celebrate its rear-wheel-drive power and ideally balanced chassis. Every brilliant detail combines purpose with poise. The result is at once timeless and trendsetting, and a sports car that seduces your gaze to linger.

    <p>AMG DYNAMIC SELECT: A fresh twist on total control.  With AMG DYNAMIC SELECT, a twist of a console knob fine-tunes the car's character. Each mode adapts the throttle maps, gear changes, and more to your driving desires, from Comfort to Sport+. The modes can also tune in the available adaptive suspension and AMG Performance exhaust. An Individual mode lets you custom-tailor a mode all your own.
    </p>

    <p>Touchpad COMAND: Easy to reach, easy to grasp.  An intuitive touchpad and sleek yet sizable 8.4" screen present your entertainment, navigation and available Internet-based apps via multi-finger gestures and animated displays. Set between the crisp analog gauges, another screen offers an exclusive AMG menu, so you can keep an eye on turbo boost, oil temperature, speed and gear selection.
